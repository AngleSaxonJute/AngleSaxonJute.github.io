## Autonomous Vehicles (AV) — Transport Technology at the Urban Periphery

This project examines the potential benefits and challenges of implementing novel transport technology in traditionally underserved areas. By focusing on the feasibility and impact of AVs at the urban periphery, we contribute to the knowledge base of innovative solutions for transportation and urban development.

Transport plays a vital role in shaping the urban landscape and residents' quality of life. However, many urban peripheries, particularly in developing regions, grapple with inadequate transport infrastructure and limited access to (modern) transport technology. Traditional economic evaluation models often deem implementing new technologies in such areas economically unviable.

We seek and understanfing of the feasibility and impact of adopting advanced transport solutions in traditionally underserved areas.

We look forward to sharing our progress with you about the future of transportation and urban development.
