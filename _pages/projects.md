### Investigating Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Acceptance â€” Transport Technology at the Urban Periphery

This project examines the potential benefits and challenges of implementing novel transport technology in traditionally underserved areas. By focusing on the feasibility and impact of AVs at the urban periphery, we contribute to the knowledge base of innovative solutions for transportation and urban development.

Transport plays a vital role in shaping urban landscapes and residents' quality of life. However, many urban peripheries, particularly in developing regions, grapple with inadequate transport infrastructure and limited access to (modern) transport technology. Traditional economic evaluation models often deem implementing new technologies in such areas economically unviable.

Through this project, we seek to provide insights into the feasibility and impact of adopting advanced transport solutions in traditionally underserved areas.

For more information about this project and to stay updated with findings, follow us at the social media links below. Additionally, partake in our 15-minute [study](https://tinyurl.com/supportindependentresearch) and be part of shaping transport for the greater good of society.

We look forward to sharing our progress with you about the future of transportation and urban development.
