### Investigating the Acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles â€” Leapfrogging Technology at the Urban Periphery

This project examines the potential benefits and challenges of implementing novel transport technology in traditionally underserved areas. By focusing on the feasibility and impact of AVs at the urban periphery, we contribute to the knowledge base of innovative solutions for transportation and urban development.

Transport plays a vital role in shaping urban landscapes and residents' quality of life. However, many urban peripheries, particularly in developing regions, grapple with inadequate transport infrastructure and limited access to (modern) transport technology. Traditional economic evaluation models often deem implementing new technologies in such areas economically unviable. Hence, through our research, we seek to provide insights into the feasibility and impact of adopting advanced transport solutions in traditionally underserved areas.

In particular, we investigate dimensions such as technological feasibility, social acceptance, economic viability, infrastructure and connectivity requirements, governance and policy considerations, and the socioeconomic impact. Through our research, we aim to inform policymakers, urban planners, and cognate stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding the adoption of leapfrogging technology and advancing the acceptance of autonomous vehicles at the urban periphery.

For more information about our project and to stay updated with our findings, befriend us at our social media links below. Or partake in our 15-minute [study](https://tinyurl.com/supportindependentresearch) and be part of shaping transport for the greater good of society.

We look forward to sharing our progress chat about the future of transportation and urban development.
