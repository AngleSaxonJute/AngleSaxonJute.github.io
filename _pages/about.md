Welcome to a jolly good adventure at our esteemed forum. Here at Angle, Saxon and Jute, we're diving headfirst into the captivating world of technology for social change and tackling those pesky aspects of social inequity. 

Our mission? To explore the astonishing world of technological marvels and harness their powers for the greater good. From code-cracking wizards to visionary inventors, we aim at assembling a merry band of intellectuals to guide us through this grand adventure.

But hold onto your monocles, for we won't stop at mere theoretical musings or stuffy academic affairs. Oh, no! We're infusing this soiree with a healthy dose of wit and charm. Picture debates between inventors and cheeky robots, trading banter over a cup of steaming tea. Now wouldn't that be a sight to experience? More realistically, however, our open lectures shall be a delighful mix of enlightenment and entertainment, where we delve into the depths of knowledge while having a jolly good laugh.

With one eye fixed on the future and the other on social justice, we delve into the knotty tangle of social inequity. From dismantling barriers that hinder progress to unleashing the potential of technology for the marginalized, together we're determined to make a difference. We'll challenge conventional notions, question the status quo, and spark conversations that reverberate through the hallowed halls of change.

So, whether you're a sauve professor or a wide-eyed scholar, a tech-aficionado, a chap or chapette with a curious mind or simply a self-proclaimed tea connoisseur, join us on this audacious escapade. Let's unlock the secrets and potential of technology for social change, create a world where fairness reigns supreme, and share a hearty laugh or two along the way.

Welcome to the Angle, Saxon, and Jute forum, where curiosity meets innovation, and the pursuit of a brighter future is seasoned with a healthy dose of humour.
