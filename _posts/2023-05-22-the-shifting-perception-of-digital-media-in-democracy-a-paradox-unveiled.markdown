In this epoch of rapid technological advancements, the digital media landscape has metamorphosed, ushering a paradox that echoes through the annals of history. Once hailed as the harbinger of democratic empowerment, digital media has not so long ago casted a shadow over the democratic polity, stoking fears and suspicions of its influence on political outcomes. The enigma of this shift in perception, warrants pondering the sociology of the internet and the tumultuous journey of digital media in democracy.

At inception, digital media was celebrated for its disruptive capacity, championed for its role in undermining authoritarian regimes and illuminating the dark corners of representative chambers. It was seen as a beacon of hope, a catalyst for participatory democracy, where citizens could be emancipated through the power of information and connectivity. Yet, as time unraveled, the very promise that digital media held dear began to crumble under the weight of disinformation, malicious hacking, and propaganda.

The Cambridge Analytica incident — that cannot be ignored — serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers thus referenced. The revelation that personal data of millions of users was harvested without consent for political purposes sent shockwaves through the democratic landscape. The clandestine manipulation of digital media to not only erode privacy, but also sway public opinion left democracy vulnerable to exploitation. The once-promising tool for empowering citizens had turned into a weapon of mass deception.

Digital media had its fair share of impact in shaping political outcomes. The Brexit referendum on European Union membership and the 2016 US presidential election both bore witness to the influence of digital media's controlling hand on polity. These events were marred by claims of disinformation and foreign interference. The power of social media to spread propaganda and target potential gullible supporters became evident, raising questions about the integrity of democratic processes in the digital age.

As Brian Loader's insightful book chapter, "What remains of digital democracy? Contemporary political cleavages and democratic practices," suggests, we must not be beguiled by the allure of digital media's potential for empowerment. Instead, we must candidly appraise the contested nature of digital communications technologies and democracy. The misconception that digital media is inherently democratic hinders us from recognising the need for political engagement in its ownership, development, and regulation.

He further opines that our understanding of digital media in democracy must transcend "value-neutral depictions", for technologies are not mere tools devoid of political implications. They are shaped by the intentions and values of those involved in its development and diffusion. The very essence of democratic practice lies in its relational, spatial, and collective nature, where social interaction and communication play inextricable roles.

Him envisioning democracy as a set of cultural practices undertaken by groups of citizens, manifested through institutions, social structures, symbolic narratives, social action, discourses, and communication technologies, the concept of democratic practice offers a profound perspective. Inasmuch as the contingent and vulnerable nature of democratic practice, we are reminded that democracy is not a "solid or static" entity "bestowed upon us", but rather an ever-evolving "assemblage of cultural practices".

Within the crucible of democratic politics, digital media is a political culture, shaped by social contexts that both facilitate and restrict democratic practices. The intertwining of digital media and democracy necessitates an exploration of their context-specific manifestations. Each political cultural context gives rise to unique variants of digitally informed democratic politics, shaped by the social and historical contexts of citizens' lives.

However, we must not shy away from acknowledging the darker aspects of democratic politics in the digital age. As Brian Loader eloquently points out, in times of crises and "growing social inequality", political practices may emerge "that are neither emancipatory nor conducive to positive outcomes for democracy". Democracy must accommodate voices of dissent, even those that threaten its own destruction, to remain inclusive and responsive.

In conclusion, the paradox of digital media in democracy is a profound and dynamic interplay of promises and perils. In keeping with Loader's conviction, we must recognise the "contested nature of digital communications technologies" and their interdependence with democratic practices. The power struggles between social groups and the values embedded in the design and adoption of digital media must not be underestimated.
