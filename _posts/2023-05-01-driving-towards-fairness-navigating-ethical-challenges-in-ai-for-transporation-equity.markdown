# Introduction
As AI has become interlined with most aspects of our daily lives, the ethical implcations that accompany its immese power resounds the importance to take a minute and reflect on what that would mean for transportation When motivated by promises of revolutionising mobility, optimising efficiency, or enhancing safety, it is no suprise that the realm of transportation responded in kind to AI becoming increasingly integrated into our transportation systems. But, as history has taught us that amidst such technological revolutions, there are often ethical challenges that lurk beneath the surface, cautioning us to tread carefully. And it is indeed this clarity of mind that is required in view of ensuring transportation equity.

Broadly understood as the principle of providing fair and just access to transportation resources, transport equity is at the heart of creating inclusive and sustainable communities. While the playing field can be leveled by AI, so too can it possess the potential to reinforce existing inqualities that perpuate injustces. Harnessing the full potential of AI while safegaurding transport equity warrants finding our way through these ethical challges. 

In this article we navigate this complex landscape where Transport Equity intersects AI, staking out markers to orient ourselfs within this uncharted territory of ethical considerations. We do so by confronting fundamental questions such as: How we must ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably accross diverse communities? Or how can we design AI systems that uphold transportation equity? By thinking in this way we forge a path toward a more just and accessible transport landscape.

# Understanding the Impact of AI in Transporation Engineering
Of the areas in which AI is being utilised in transport engineering to transform various aspects transportation systems is the optimisation of traffic flow, enhance safety, and improve efficiency. As real-time data are increasingly being pipelined with relative ease from sources such as sensors, cameras, and GPS devises, AI algorithms intelligently adjusttraffic signal timing, predict congestion patterns, and optimise alternate routing. Dynamically adapting to changing traffic conditions, AI helps reduce congestion, minimise travel times, and improve the overall efficiency of transportation networks.

Enhancing safety is another significant benefit of AI in transport. By way of AI empowered technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are able to make sense of their surroundings, enact real-time decisions and navigate roads autonomously. This advancement in AV technology holds the potential to enhance safety on the roads by minimizing human errors and improving response times


Since AI systems learn from vast amounts of data, which inadvertantly reflect societal prejudices and disparities, one of the primary concerns surrounding AI is its potential to pertuate and amplify existing biases. This bias can manifest in variours ways for tranporation.
