But, as history has taught us that amidst such technological revolutions, there are often ethical challenges that lurk beneath the surface, cautioning us to tread carefully. And it is indeed this clarity of mind that is required in view of ensuring transportation equity.

Broadly understood as the principle of providing fair and just access to transportation resources, transport equity is at the heart of creating inclusive and sustainable communities. While the playing field can be levelled by AI, so too can it possess the potential to reinforce existing inequalities that perpetuate injustices. Harnessing the full potential of AI while safeguarding transport equity warrants finding our way through these ethical challenges. 

In this article we navigate this complex landscape where Transport Equity intersects AI, staking out markers to orient ourselves within this uncharted territory of ethical considerations. We do so by confronting fundamental questions such as: How we must ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably across diverse communities? Or how can we design AI systems that uphold transportation equity? Thinking in this way we forges a path toward a more just and accessible transport landscape.

## Understanding the Impact of AI in Transporation Engineering
Of the areas in which AI is being utilised in transport engineering to transform various aspects transportation systems is the optimisation of traffic flow, enhance safety, and improve efficiency. As real-time data are increasingly being pipelined with relative ease from sources such as sensors, cameras, and GPS devises, AI algorithms intelligently adjusttraffic signal timing, predict congestion patterns, and optimise alternate routing. Dynamically adapting to changing traffic conditions, AI helps reduce congestion, minimise travel times, and improve the overall efficiency of transportation networks.

Enhancing safety is a significant benefit of AI in transport. By way of AI empowered technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are able to make sense of their surroundings, enact real-time decisions and navigate roads autonomously. Advancements in AV technology holds the potential to enhance safety on the roads by minimizing human error and improving response time. Increased mobility and access for individuals unable to drive are another two areas in which AI can contribute toward safety. In so doing, options previously out of reach are made accessible while improving the efficiency of the transport system.

AI is also making significant impact on the efficiency of the transport systems notably in the area of predictive maintenance. Here, large volumes of data from transportation infrastructure and vehicles are analysed to predict potential failures or maintenance needs. Flagging maintenance requirements in advance allows transport agencies to proactively schedule repairs and ensure asset reliability as  well as longevity. Efficiency is thus enhanced by this predictive approach reducing the risk of breakdowns, ensuring effective maintenance operations that contribute to better transport infrastructure.

In sum, AI is being utilized in transport engineering to optimize traffic flow, develop autonomous vehicles, and enable predictive maintenance. While these are only some of the areas of AI application, efficiency is improved, safety is enhanced, which in total contribute to the overall effectiveness of transportation systems. By harnessing AI's capabilities, transportation is undergoing transformative changes, paving the way for more sustainable, accessible, and efficient transport networks for the future. 

## The Ethics of Fairness and Equity in AI
Fairness and equity are fundamental principles that need to be embedded in AI systems deployed in transportation engineering to ensure a just and inclusive society. In transportation, the significance of fairness and equity rest upon ensuring equal access to transportation resources, opportunities, and benefits for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic background, race, gender, or other characteristics. By incorporating fairness and equity into AI systems, transportation engineering can strive to create inclusive and accessible transportation networks that cater to the needs of all individuals.

Fairness refers to the impartial treatment of individuals and groups. Equity, on the other hand, goes beyond equality by acknowledging and addressing historical and systemic inequalities that redress and allocate proportional opportunities and resources to different marginalised communities. One of the primary concerns surrounding AI is its potential to perpetuate and amplify existing biases. AI systems learn from vast amounts of data that inadvertently reflect societal prejudices and disparities if not curtailed. These biases can manifest in various ways, leading to unfair outcomes and unequal access to transportation resources. By prioritizing fairness, transportation engineers can work towards designing AI systems that actively counteract biases and ensure equal treatment and opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or gender.

Broader societal goals such as the promotion of social justice are concomitantly brought into the fold when addressing fairness and equity in AI. Transportation is a crucial aspect of people's daily lives, affecting their access to education, employment, healthcare, and other essential services. By embracing fairness and equity in AI systems and re-examining transportation through the lens of social justice can help bridge the gaps in transport access and improve the quality of life for (marginalized) communities. Enabling therefore a more inclusive society where transportation resources are distributed equitably, and everyone has an equal chance to thrive and participate in economic and social activities.

Fairness and equity form the ethical foundation for AI systems in transportation engineering. Prioritizing these principles ensures that transportation networks are designed and managed in a way that promotes equal access, opportunity, and benefits for all individuals. By recognizing and mitigating biases, transportation engineers can build AI systems that contribute to a more just and equitable society, where transportation serves as a catalyst for social mobility and fosters inclusive and sustainable communities.

Taken together, an ethical framework embedding AI in transportation should thus emphasize transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. Transparency entails making the decision processes of AI systems understandable and explainable to users and affected communities, ensuring that biases and discriminatory practices can be identified and addressed. Accountability means that developers, operators, and policymakers are responsible for the outcomes of AI systems. Mechanisms should be in place to rectify any unintended biases or discriminatory impacts. Finally, inclusivity involves the inclusion of a diverse stakeholder count that include representatives from marginalized communities in the design and evaluation of AI systems to ensure that their perspectives and needs are considered.

By establishing an ethical framework that prioritizes fairness and equity, transport engineers can leverage AI systems to create more equitable and just transportation networks. Through the exploration of ethical challenges and considerations in this article, light is shed on the potential biases, risks, and opportunities associated with AI in transportation. By doing so, we can work towards harnessing AI's potential to enhance transportation equity, address systemic inequalities, and create a future where access to safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation is available to all.

## Bias and Discrimination in Transportation AI Systems
Given the current climate of data regulation, the nature of data being collected, and those collecting this information, biases can emerge from various sources, including biased training data, algorithmic design, or inherent societal biases. These biases can lead to unfair outcomes, discrimination, and perpetuate existing inequalities. For instance, in ride-hailing platforms, algorithms may inadvertently assign higher fares or longer wait times to certain neighbourhoods based on historical data, reinforcing transportation disparities in underserved communities. This oversight can result from biased training data that reflects historical inequalities in transportation access.

Another real-world example is facial recognition technology used in transportation security systems. Studies have shown that facial recognition algorithms can exhibit racial and gender biases, leading to higher false positive rates for certain demographic groups. This bias can disproportionately impact individuals from marginalized communities, subjecting them to increased scrutiny and potential discrimination. Such biases can have profound ethical implications, as they violate principles of fairness, equality, and non-discrimination.

Addressing biases in transportation AI systems is crucial to ensure equitable outcomes. It requires transparency in the design and deployment of algorithms; rigorous testing and evaluation to identify and mitigate biases; and diverse and inclusive data sources. Collaborative efforts between transportation engineers, AI researchers, policymakers, and communities are necessary to address these biases effectively, not least the essentiality of the development and enforcement of regulations and guidelines that promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems.

The ethical implications of these biases highlight the urgency to prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI development and deployment. Striving for unbiased and equitable AI systems in transportation ensures that our technological advancements align with the principles of justice, equality, and social progress.

## Strategies for Ensuring Fairness and Equity in Transportation AI 
In the quest of fairness and equity in transportation AI systems, it's essential to employ strategies that combat biases and ensure equal treatment of all. Hence, in view of the above ethical framework, let's buckle up and explore some of these approaches to mitigate biases and promote a fair and equitable transportation future.

#### Diversification of Datasets
To steer clear of biased AI systems, we need to ensure our datasets represent the full spectrum of human diversity. By embracing the mantra of inclusivity data from a wide range of sources and communities are paramount. Relying solely on data from the old GPS-wielding uncles who always seem to take the scenic route will not cut it. Algorithms trained on diversified data are better equipped, for example, to understand nuances of different neighbourhoods, preferences, and travel patterns.

#### Algorithmic Auditing
Just like we have tests for vehicles, ensuring that they uphold the minimum safety, environment, and roadworthiness standards, so we must have regular check-ups and evaluations of our AI systems to help spot and address any biases that may have snuck in. By scrutinizing the inner workings of our algorithms, we can ensure they are making decisions that are fair, transparent, and free from discriminatory impact.
